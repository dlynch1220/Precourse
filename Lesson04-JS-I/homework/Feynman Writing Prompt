Variables:

Using variables is like putting something in the trash can. It can be a number, a string, or anything you like. When you close the trash can
The trash can stores it in memory. You are then able to open the trash can as many times as you want and use it for anything you like.

Strings:

Strings are like your name. You have a name so if your name is "Marcus" then you would be able to call this name and then remember all
the information about this name. This name can be used in a list or a dictionary or an array.

Functions:

Functions is something that when you put something in it, then it puts something out. If I give you a 2 dollars to buy me bread, then the 
function is that it goes to the store to get bread. and you come back with bread so the function would have two purposes:
1. to get bread
2. to bring it back

If Statements:

If statements is like betting. It is a calculation. If I say: If you do your homework you will go outside and play. Well, if you don't do your
homework you can go out. So If statements are like a function that gives you two choices for something. Yes and No.

Boolean:

Booleans are True and False. If I showed you 10 marbles and you counted it and guessed that I had 10 marbles, then that statement would be
True. If I showed you 10 marbles and you counted 9 marbles, then I would have to say False.
