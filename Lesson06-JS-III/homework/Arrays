An array is a set of numbers or strings used to store information. IF you had things you wanted from the store that you wanted your mom
to buy then that would be an array. But you have to ask which one would you wanted first? Which one would you want second? Which one would 
you want 3rd? Arrays are interesting because you can rearrange them. You can make something that should be first, last or you can switch them.
You can loop them and run them however you like. The computer reads the program to whatever you want it to do!
