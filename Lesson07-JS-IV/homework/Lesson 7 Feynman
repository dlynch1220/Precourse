Objects are very important. Like the lesson says: everything is an object. That means that if you had toys in your room then you would call
each of these an object. And these objects would do certain things. But what you must know is that some objects are similar to each other
and some objects are different. So it is important to put these objects into groups called classes. You could make two boxes and one box could have
your red toys and the other box would have your blue toys and then you could take these two toys and put them into a bigger box called toys.

Methods are functions. Each function is a method. Methods cannot be changed like functions. They are more specific. If I said tie your shoe 
then you would take one string and tied around and then loop it inside and make a knot right? Well this would be specific thing that you
would do. Then I would say clean your room and brush your teeth. Each thing I told you to do would be a function. A function is like an order.

All of these orders make up a program!


Properties in programming would be like things you like about your toys. If I said what do you like about your red truck? You would say it's
red, it has four wheels, it shoots water, etc. These are values. This is what a property is.

Dot notation is bracket notation is like writing your name. If there is a special way to write your name then you must do it that way. Imagine writing
your name "Monica Flores" well with dot notation you would put Monica.Flores. and bracket notation is used for your arguement. You would insert
your arguement in the brackets. 

For In Loops.
This makes an array able to do something over and over.
