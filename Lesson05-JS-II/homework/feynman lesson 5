A FOR LOOP is a function that can do something a number of times. Imagine if I said, say your name 5 times. If your name is Monica, well that
would be a loop. You would say: "Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica." That would be a loop because the statement would go around and around.

&& 

This is an operator. You can combine two sentences together. Just think of two sentences about yourself that you like. You can say 
"I like video games" and "I like candy." then you can take && and add the two together. Because the two are true, you can add them.

||

This shows a False value. Anything you say with two sentences is returned as False. So if I say: "I like video games" and "I like candy"
then that would not be True. Don't get mad if it's not true! It's just computer programming!

!!!!

These mean NOT. So let's go back to the two sentences: "I lke video games" and "I like candy." What if we said: I hate video games and I hate 
candy? Well with ! this means that it would be true.
